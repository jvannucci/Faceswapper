I took the code from project at https://github.com/matthewearl/faceswap/blob/master/faceswap.py and modified the program to faceswapper.py, which swaps batches of faces from the /face/ and /body/ subfolders, which will be outputted to the home directory. You can then use the filter.py script to sort by source image, with the ability to double click the best faceswap and remove the rest. In addition, I have made each faceswap duplicated, reversing the incoming face to make angled face shots more likely to match. Use splitter.py and the left and right arrow keys to cycle through the home directory, saving the left or right picture in the /saved/ folder.
